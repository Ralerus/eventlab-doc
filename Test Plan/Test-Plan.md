## 6. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 6.1 Test Plan

#### 6.1.1 Test Plan Entry Criteria

Building a new version of the software using the existing deployment and test environment. This environment consists of Travis CI to detect commits on GitHub and automatically test the software. Therefore, the in chapter 5 described test approaches will be executed. Additionally, two Heroku instances for development/test and production are used.

#### 6.1.2 Test Plan Exit Criteria

After all test run without throwing an exception, the software will be deployed to the both Heroku instances.

#### 6.1.3 Suspension and Resumption Criteria

n/a

### 6.2 Test Cycles

#### 6.2.1 Test Cycle Entry Criteria

For each commit on GitHub a test run will be executed automatically. Due to the fact, that each feature will be developed in a separate branch, for the pull requests to dev and master branches additional test runs are executed. The developer has tested his code locally beforehand.

#### 6.2.2 Test Cycle Exit Criteria

The code coverage report will automatically generated and the badge on the GitHub Repository will be updated. The deployment is only for the master and dev branch on GitHub configured.

#### 6.2.3 Test Cycle Abnormal Termination

Travis CI will report errors of the test failed or was cancelled. If the deployment fails, the Travis CI report will state these errors as well.

## 7. Deliverables

### 7.1 Test Evaluation Summaries

You can find the test evaluation summary on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/tarjmp/eventlab/) or on [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tarjmp/eventlab/commits).

### 7.2 Reporting on Test Coverage

A Code coverage report is generated by codecov which is triggered by Travis CI automatically. You can find the report [here](https://codecov.io/gh/tarjmp/eventlab).

### 7.3 Perceived Quality Reports

You can find a code coverage badge in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tarjmp/eventlab).

### 7.4 Incident Logs and Change Requests

You can find the incident logs [here](https://travis-ci.org/tarjmp/eventlab/).

### 7.5 Smoke Test Suite and Supporting Test Scripts

n/a

### 7.6 Additional Work Products

#### 7.6.1 Detailed Test Results

You can find the detailed test run report [here](https://travis-ci.org/tarjmp/eventlab/). The Coverage Chart can be found for this project can be found on [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/tarjmp/eventlab).

#### 7.6.2 Additional Automated Functional Test Scripts

n/a

#### 7.6.3 Test Guidelines

The unit test shall cover all expected and unexpected inputs and conditions. To ensure this condition is met, a review from a second group member is required, when merging the code to the dev/test and production infrastructure. Additionally, for each commit the unit tests will be executed automatically. If they fail, the code cannot be merged.

#### 7.6.4 Traceability Matrices

n/a

## 8. Testing Workflow

Currently tests are executed manually and automatically before deploying to a server.

Therefore, the program and test code will be developed in a separate branch for each feature. The developer runs the tests locally and fixes all bugs found. During this step he commits his work to GitHub where all tests are executed. After all work is uploaded, he wants to merge his code into the dev/test environment. During this step, the tests will be executed again. After all checks have been passed and a second group member has approved the test cases, the code will be merged. We are using Travis CI to automatically run the defined tests and to deploy the software to different servers (Heroku). The deployment only takes place when all tests have been passed. These tests are PHP Unit tests. Travis CI also installs all required dependencies, which are specified in config files.

## 9. Environmental Needs

### 9.1 Base System Hardware

The following table sets forth the system resources for the test effort presented in this Test Plan.

| Resource | Quantity | Name | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Integration Server | 1 | Travis CI Worker | Ubuntu Server 14.04.5 amd64 |
| Development Server | 3 | localhost (php artisan serve) | PHP Built-in web server |
| Database | 2 | Heroku | PostgreSQL	|
| Test/Development Server | 1 | Heroku | <Server> |
| Productive Server | 1 | Heroku |<Server> |

### 9.2 Base Software Elements in the Test Environment

The following base software elements are required in the test environment for this Test Plan.

| Software Element Name | Version | Type and Other Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | 10 1809 | Operating System (64-bit) |
| Chrome |  74 	| Internet Browser (64-bit) |
| FireFox |  66	| Internet Browser (64-bit) |
| Chromedriver |  11 | Application |

### 9.3 Productivity and Support Tools

The following tools will be employed to support the test process for this Test Plan.

| Tool Category or Type | Tool Brand Name | Vendor or In-house | Version |
|---|---|---|---|
| IDE | PhpStorm | JetBrains | 2019.1.1 |
| Feature Test | Intellij | JetBrains | 17.2 |
| Language | PHP | The PHP Group | 7.3 |
| Framework | Laravel | Taylor Otwell | 5.8 |
| Project Management | YouTrack | JetBrains | 2019.1 |
| DBMS tools |	pgAdmin | Open Source | 4.5 |

### 9.4 Test Environment Configurations

The following Test Environment Configurations needs to be provided and supported for this project.

| Configuration Name | Description | Implemented in Physical Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Average user configuration | To run UI test, you need an GUI, our application reachable (local server or internet connection) and a Java Runtime Environment installed. | A monitor with the according computer to run Java is required. |
| Minimal configuration supported | The minimal configuration to execute the PHP Unit tests is that PhP v7.2 installed. | We use Travis CI which offers Virtual Machines, where PHP can be installed. |
| Visually and mobility challenged | As we are using the Bootstrap framework, some features are implemented. | You can find those feature [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/accessibility/). |
| International Double Byte OS | n/a | n/a |
| Network installation (not client) | As we are developing a Web application, an internet connection is required to test and use this application. | As our automated test environment also runs in the internet, a continuous internet connection is required. |
