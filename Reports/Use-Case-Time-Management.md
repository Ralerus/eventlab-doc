>\* <ul style="margin-left:0.5em; padding-left:0.5em;">"Login" and "Edit User Profile" where the first use cases, which we mostly generated with Laravel. That was the reason why we didn't create the "Use Case Specifications" for these two use cases and didn't calculate function points (FP). The time we tracked for documentation can also be seen as initial setup time.
